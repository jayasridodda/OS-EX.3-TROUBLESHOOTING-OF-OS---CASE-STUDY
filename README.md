STEP-4:  Restart the System

A simple restart can often fix minor glitches and improve system performance.

STEP-5:  Check Hardware
If it's a hardware-related issue, ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and functioning. Look for loose cables, overheating, or hardware failures.

STEP-7:  Review Event Logs
Check the system logs for error messages or warnings that might provide clues about the issue. In Windows, you can use the Event Viewer; in Linux, check syslog or journalctl.

STEP-9:  Safe Mode
Boot the system into safe mode to check if the problem persists. Safe mode loads the OS with minimal drivers and can help identify if third-party software is causing the issue.
